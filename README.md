Coffee Shop Management System

The Coffee Shop Management System is a web-based application developed to automate and manage the daily operations of a coffee shop efficiently. This project is designed as part of the DBS Lab course and focuses on reducing manual work while improving accuracy in order processing, inventory management, and customer handling. The system provides an organized and user-friendly interface for managing coffee shop activities.

The system allows the admin to manage products, view orders, and maintain inventory, while staff members can process customer orders and manage reservations. Customers can view the menu, place orders, and make reservations conveniently. The project is developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it suitable for small to medium-sized coffee shops.
